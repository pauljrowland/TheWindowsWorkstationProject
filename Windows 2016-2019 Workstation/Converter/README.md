This converter has only been tested on Windows Server 2016. A WIP is in place for 2019 as some of the commands are slightly different. The majority of the features included in the Win 2016 version are compatible and will work as expected.

I have been hard at work trying to automate the majority of the conversion, but some things are proving to be a bit tricker than youâ€™d expect due to things like Group Policy restrictions or security settings. If you wish to share any ideas or improvements, please use the comments box at the bottom of this page.
