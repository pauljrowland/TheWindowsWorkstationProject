# TheWindowsWorkstationProject

Welcome to the Windows Workstation Project GitHub!.

Established in 2008, this is a community driven effort to convert Microsoft Windows Server operating systems into recognisable day-to-day Windows Desktops.

When Windows Server is converted to a workstation, the performance can actually beat that of the client edition â€“ however the initial setup can take some time, so we have hopefully made it nice and easy.

Here are some of the resources linked to from the main site to ensure they are alway accessible. All content is freely available for re-use or modification as you please!
